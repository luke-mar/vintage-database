This is a React project. An array of product objects is pulled from a firestore database. The configuration for the database I used is hidden. An example object from the array that is returned is :
        {
        "name": "Faded Black 80s Levis",
        "nickname": "product-23",
        "size": "37",
        "image1": "https://imgur.com/XX64FNR.jpg",
        "image2": "https://imgur.com/EE1eDVf.jpg",
        "image3": "https://imgur.com/77TvYll.jpg",
        "image4": "",
        "image5": "",
        "description": "Faded Black 80s Distressed Levis. Tapered",
        "store": "store2",
        "price": 60,
        "stock": true,
        "quantity": 1,
        "measurements": ""
        }
